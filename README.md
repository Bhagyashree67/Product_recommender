Product_recommender using Sentiment Analysis (NLP)
Goals: Suggest top five products for the investment bracket, with detailed report sentiment analysis on those products reviews.


Conclusion:

1. Building an item-based collaborative filtering system based on K - nearest neighbors to find the  most similar products. I used Amazon Home and Kitchen reviews dataset. Also, build K neighbors classifier model to predict overall review rating based on text reviews.

2. Analyzing the performance metrics of the above recommender system 



Within this e-commerce data science project.

1. we have come up with KNN product recommendater system for customers based on their purchase history and product reviews (Amazon's home and kitchen dataset)

2. we also performed sentiment analysis on any given product for a given customer (Amazon's home and kitchen dataset)
